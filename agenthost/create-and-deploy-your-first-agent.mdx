# Create and Deploy Your First Agent

Welcome to AgentHost! This guide will walk you through creating and deploying your first AI agent in just a few minutes. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional agent running on our platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AgentHost account (sign up at [agenthost.ai](https://agenthost.ai))
- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- A clear idea of what you want your agent to do

## Step 1: Create Your Agent

### Access the Agent Builder

1. Log into your AgentHost dashboard
2. Click the **"Create New Agent"** button
3. Choose your preferred creation method:
   - **Quick Start Template** - Use pre-built templates
   - **Custom Agent** - Build from scratch
   - **Import Existing** - Import from another platform

<Note>
We recommend starting with a Quick Start Template for your first agent to understand the platform basics.
</Note>

### Configure Basic Settings

Fill in your agent's basic information:

```json Agent Configuration
{
  "name": "My First Agent",
  "description": "A helpful customer service agent",
  "language": "en",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo"
}
```

<Accordion title="Available Models">
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** - Best for complex reasoning and conversations
  - **GPT-3.5 Turbo** - Fast and cost-effective for most use cases
  - **Claude 3 Sonnet** - Excellent for creative and analytical tasks
  - **Custom Models** - Use your own fine-tuned models
</Accordion>

## Step 2: Define Agent Behavior

### Set Your Agent's Personality

Configure how your agent should behave and respond:

```yaml Agent Personality
system_prompt: |
  You are a helpful customer service agent for AgentHost.
  You should be friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about our platform.
  Always aim to solve the user's problem efficiently.

tone: "friendly_professional"
response_style: "concise_but_helpful"
```

### Configure Response Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Response Timing">
    - **Response Delay**: 0-3 seconds (simulates thinking time)
    - **Typing Indicator**: Shows when agent is "typing"
    - **Read Receipts**: Indicates when messages are read
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="message" title="Message Handling">
    - **Max Response Length**: 500-4000 characters
    - **Context Window**: How much conversation history to remember
    - **Fallback Responses**: What to say when uncertain
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Set Up Agent Capabilities

### Enable Core Features

Choose which capabilities your agent should have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Conversations" icon="message">
    Handle text-based conversations with users
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Processing" icon="file">
    Read and analyze uploaded documents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Access real-time information from the web
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect to external services and databases
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Configure Integrations

Connect your agent to external services:

```bash Environment Variables
# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

# External APIs
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
CRM_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.yourcrm.com/v1

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

<Warning>
Store sensitive credentials securely using AgentHost's environment variable system. Never hardcode secrets in your agent configuration.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

### Use the Built-in Simulator

Before deploying, test your agent using our built-in simulator:

1. Click **"Test Agent"** in the agent builder
2. Start a conversation with your agent
3. Try various scenarios and edge cases
4. Refine the configuration based on test results

### Common Test Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Happy Path">
    Test normal conversations where everything works as expected:
    - Greeting the agent
    - Asking common questions
    - Following the intended conversation flow
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Edge Cases">
    Test unusual or challenging scenarios:
    - Very long messages
    - Multiple questions in one message
    - Requests outside the agent's scope
    - Inappropriate or harmful content
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Error Handling">
    Test how the agent handles errors:
    - Network connectivity issues
    - API timeouts
    - Invalid input formats
    - System maintenance scenarios
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Deploy Your Agent

### Choose Deployment Method

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="Cloud Deployment">
    Deploy to AgentHost's managed infrastructure:
    - **Instant scaling** based on demand
    - **Global CDN** for low latency
    - **Automatic backups** and disaster recovery
    - **99.9% uptime** SLA
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="server" title="Self-Hosted">
    Deploy to your own infrastructure:
    - Full control over environment
    - Custom security configurations
    - Integration with existing systems
    - Compliance with specific regulations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Production Configuration

Before going live, review these production settings:

```yaml Production Checklist
security:
  rate_limiting: true
  input_validation: strict
  content_filtering: enabled
  
monitoring:
  logging_level: info
  metrics_collection: true
  error_reporting: enabled
  
performance:
  auto_scaling: true
  max_concurrent_users: 1000
  response_cache: 300 # seconds
```

### Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy to Production"**
2. Choose your deployment region
3. Configure auto-scaling settings
4. Review and confirm deployment

<Note>
Deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes. You'll receive an email notification when your agent is live.
</Note>

## Step 6: Monitor and Maintain

### Monitor Performance

Access real-time metrics in your dashboard:

- **Response times** - Average and 95th percentile
- **User satisfaction** - Based on user feedback
- **Error rates** - Track and resolve issues quickly
- **Usage patterns** - Understand peak times and popular features
